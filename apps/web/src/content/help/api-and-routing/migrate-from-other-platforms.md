Use `/migrate` for guided migration steps and side-by-side code changes.

Suggested migration flow:

1. Choose your current provider or SDK.
2. Select integration style (SDK or REST).
3. Apply the generated diff and test one endpoint at a time.

Start with low-risk requests, then expand traffic gradually once latency and cost targets are stable.
