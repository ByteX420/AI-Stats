If sign-in is failing, run through this checklist in order:

1. Confirm your browser is allowing first-party cookies.
2. Open the site in a private window to rule out extension conflicts.
3. Make sure your system clock is set correctly.
4. Retry the same provider from `/sign-in`.

If OAuth callback errors continue, capture the full URL and timestamp, then contact support.
