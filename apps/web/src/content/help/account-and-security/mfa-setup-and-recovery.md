Enable MFA from `Settings -> Account` to protect your API keys and billing actions.

Recommended setup:

- Register an authenticator app first.
- Store backup codes in a secure password manager.
- Confirm a fresh sign-in after setup.

If you lose your device, use backup codes to sign in, then rotate MFA immediately.
