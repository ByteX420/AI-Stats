# Migration Guides

Welcome to the AI Stats migration guides. These guides provide step-by-step instructions to help you migrate your integrations, whether upgrading between versions of the AI Stats API and SDKs or migrating from other AI platforms and gateways.

## Types of migration guides

We provide two main categories of migration guides:

### 1. AI Stats breaking changes

These guides help you upgrade between different versions of the AI Stats platform when we introduce breaking changes. They cover:

-   **Breaking changes**: Updates that may require code modifications
-   **New features**: How to take advantage of new capabilities
-   **Deprecated functionality**: What to replace and how
-   **Best practices**: Recommendations for smooth upgrades

Each guide includes:

-   Overview of changes
-   Detailed migration steps
-   Code examples
-   Troubleshooting tips

### 2. Migrating from other platforms

These guides help you migrate your existing integrations from other AI platforms, SDKs, and gateways to AI Stats. We currently provide guides for:

-   [OpenAI SDK Migration](./from-openai.mdx)
-   [Anthropic SDK Migration](./from-anthropic.mdx)
-   [OpenRouter Migration](./from-openrouter.mdx)
-   [Vercel AI Gateway Migration](./from-vercel.mdx)
-   [LiteLLM Migration](./from-litellm.mdx)
-   [Cloudflare AI Gateway Migration](./from-cloudflare.mdx)
-   [Helicone AI Gateway Migration](./from-helicone.mdx)

## Integrations and compatibility

If you are not migrating but want to connect a tool directly, start with the [Integrations overview](../guides/integrations/index.mdx).

## How to use these guides

1. **Identify your migration type**: Determine if you're upgrading AI Stats versions or migrating from another platform.
2. **Find the relevant guide**: Select the migration guide that matches your scenario.
3. **Follow the steps sequentially**: Execute the changes in the order provided.
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify your integration works after migration.
5. **Refer to the API reference**: Use the updated API documentation for implementation details.

## Available AI Stats breaking change guides

No breaking change migration guides are currently available. They will be added here as needed for future version upgrades.
