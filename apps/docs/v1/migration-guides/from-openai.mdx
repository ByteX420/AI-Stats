# Migrating from OpenAI SDK

This guide will help you migrate your existing OpenAI SDK (Python or Node.js) integration to use the AI Stats Gateway instead.

## Overview

AI Stats Gateway provides OpenAI-compatible endpoints, making migration straightforward. You'll primarily need to:

-   Change the API base URL
-   Update your API key
-   Update authentication method (from `api_key` to `Authorization: Bearer`)

## Prerequisites

-   An AI Stats account and API key (get one at [Gateway Keys](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app/gateway/keys))
-   Existing OpenAI SDK code

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update API Key and Base URL

Instead of using the OpenAI API key and default base URL, use your AI Stats credentials.

<CodeGroup>
```bash
# Before (OpenAI)
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-openai-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'

# After (AI Stats)

curl https://api.phaseo.app/v1/chat/completions \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer your-ai-stats-key" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
"model": "gpt-4",
"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
}'

````

```python
import openai

# Before
client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="sk-your-openai-key")

# After
client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="your-ai-stats-key",
    base_url="https://api.phaseo.app/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
````

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

// Before
const client = new OpenAI({
	apiKey: "sk-your-openai-key",
});

// After
const client = new OpenAI({
	apiKey: "your-ai-stats-key",
	baseURL: "https://api.phaseo.app/v1",
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
	model: "gpt-4",
	messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Test Your Integration

Run your existing code with the updated configuration to ensure it works.

### 4. Handle Model Names

AI Stats supports a wide range of models. Check the [models endpoint](../api-reference/endpoint/models.mdx) for available models and their names.

Some model names may differ from OpenAI's naming convention.

## Common Issues

-   **Model not found**: Ensure the model name is available in AI Stats. Use the `/models` endpoint to list available models.
-   **Rate limits**: AI Stats may have different rate limits than OpenAI.
-   **Features**: Some OpenAI-specific features may not be available or work differently.

## Next Steps

-   Explore AI Stats' additional features like analytics and multi-provider routing.
-   Check out the [API Reference](../api-reference/introduction.mdx) for full documentation.
