## Where do I get an API key?

Create keys in the AI Stats dashboard. See [Authentication](../developers/authentication.mdx).

## What base URL should I use?

Use `https://api.phaseo.app/v1` as the base URL for the Gateway.

## Which endpoint should I start with?

Use `/responses` for most text workflows. `/chat/completions` and `/messages` are available for compatibility.

## How do I see supported models?

Use the [Models endpoint](../api-reference/endpoint/models.mdx) for the latest list.

## How does BYOK work?

Bring-your-own-key lets you connect provider keys while still using the Gateway. See [Management API keys](../developers/management-api-keys.mdx).

## Where can I ask for help?

See [Contact and support](./contact-and-support.mdx) for help channels.
