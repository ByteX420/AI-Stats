description: "Official Python client for the AI Stats Gateway API"
---

<Note type="warning">
  **SDKs are in very early alpha**: We're working as hard as we can to get them into a stable state. Please bear with us as we iterate rapidly.
</Note>

The AI Stats Python SDK currently provides a synchronous client for the AI Stats Gateway API.

## Features

-   Typed request models generated from the OpenAPI spec.
-   Built-in helpers for chat, responses, messages, embeddings, and moderations.
-   Streaming helpers for text, responses, and messages (`stream_*` iterators).
-   Control-plane helpers such as models, health, providers, credits, and activity.

Some surfaces are still stubbed in the Python SDK and return a `coming_soon` payload (for example images, audio, video, files, batches, and generation lookup).

## Quick example

```python
from ai_stats import AIStats

client = AIStats(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.generate_response(
    {
        "model": "openai/gpt-5-nano",
        "input": "Reply with: python sdk works",
    }
)

print(response.get("id"))
```

## What's included

-   `AIStats` client
-   `chat.completions.create(...)` and `responses.create(...)` compatibility helpers
-   Streaming iterators for text, responses, and messages
-   Generated request/response models in `ai_stats.models`
