<Note type="warning">
  The Ruby SDK is not published on RubyGems yet. Use it from source for now.
</Note>

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.1+
- Access to this repository

## Install from local source

1. Regenerate generated files (optional but recommended after API changes):

```bash
pnpm openapi:gen:ruby
```

2. Load the SDK directly from the repository path:

```ruby
require_relative '../ai-stats-public/packages/sdk/sdk-ruby/lib/index'
```

This loads the local preview wrapper and generated operations.
