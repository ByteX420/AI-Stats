<Note type="warning">
  The C# SDK is not published on NuGet yet. Use it from source for now.
</Note>

## Requirements

- .NET 8+
- Access to this repository

## Install from local source

1. Regenerate generated files (optional but recommended after API changes):

```bash
pnpm openapi:gen:csharp
```

2. Add these files to your project:

- `packages/sdk/sdk-csharp/Client.cs`
- `packages/sdk/sdk-csharp/src/gen/Client.cs`
- `packages/sdk/sdk-csharp/src/gen/Models.cs`
- `packages/sdk/sdk-csharp/src/gen/Operations.cs`

This gives you the preview wrapper plus generated operations.
