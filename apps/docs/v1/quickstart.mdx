Welcome to the **AI Stats Quickstart** - this guide will help you make your first successful API request and explore everything AI Stats has to offer.

The Gateway provides a simple and unified way to access AI models from multiple providers, without needing to juggle different APIs, keys, or formats.

---

## 1. Create an account

Sign up for a free account on the [AI Stats Dashboard](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app).  
Once logged in, click your profile photo in the top right corner, navigate to **Keys** and click **Create Key**.

This key will be used to authenticate all API requests.

<Danger>
	Keep this key secure and do not share it publicly as it gives full access to
	your credits.
</Danger>

---

## 2. Make your first request

With your API key ready, send your first request to the `/responses` endpoint.

<CodeGroup dropdown>
```bash
curl https://api.phaseo.app/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-3-pro-preview",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Give me a short fact about AI."}
    ]
  }'
```

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.phaseo.app/v1/responses", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: {
		Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
		"Content-Type": "application/json",
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({
		model: "gemini-3-pro-preview",
		messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Give me a short fact about AI." }],
	}),
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.choices[0].message.content);
```

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.phaseo.app/v1/responses"
headers = {
	"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
	"Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
	"model": "gemini-3-pro-preview",
	"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give me a short fact about AI."}]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

```typescript
import axios from "axios";

const res = await axios.post(
	"https://api.phaseo.app/v1/responses",
	{
		model: "gemini-3-pro-preview",
		messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Give me a short fact about AI." }],
	},
	{
		headers: {
			Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
			"Content-Type": "application/json",
		},
	},
);

console.log(res.data.choices[0].message.content);
```

</CodeGroup>

If successful, you'll receive a JSON response like this:

```json
{
	"id": "G-00000000000000000000000000",
	"model": "gemini-3-pro-preview",
	"choices": [
		{
			"index": 0,
			"message": {
				"role": "assistant",
				"content": "Artificial intelligence was first coined as a term in 1956 at Dartmouth College."
			},
			"finish_reason": "stop"
		}
	],
	"usage": {
		"input_tokens": 14,
		"output_tokens": 21,
		"total_tokens": 35
	}
}
```

Success - you just made your first request to the AI Stats Gateway.
You can easily modify the request to change model, the prompt, and other parameters.
