# Pricing Tiers

AI Gateway uses a simple two-tier pricing system that automatically adjusts based on your usage.

## Tier Overview

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Basic Tier" icon="tag">
    **7% gateway fee**

    Default tier for all teams. Automatic upgrade to Enterprise when you spend $10,000+ in a rolling 30-day period.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Enterprise Tier" icon="star">
    **5% gateway fee**

    Premium pricing for high-volume teams. Maintained while spending $10k+ monthly, with a 3-month grace period.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

Your tier is calculated automatically **before each request** based on your rolling 30-day spend:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your spend">
    The system calculates your total gateway spend over the last 30 days
  </Step>

  <Step title="Determine tier">
    - If spend >= $10,000 -> Enterprise (5% fee)
    - If spend < $10,000 -> Basic (7% fee)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply pricing">
    Your current request is processed with the appropriate tier's fee
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Scenario

```
Day 1-20: Total spend = $8,000
  -> All requests pay 7% (Basic tier)

Day 21: Spend reaches $10,500
  -> This request pays 7% (Basic)
  -> Tier upgraded to Enterprise

Day 22+: Total 30-day spend = $11,000
  -> All requests pay 5% (Enterprise tier) [DONE]
```

## Grace Period

Enterprise teams have a **3-month grace period** to prevent immediate downgrades due to temporary spending fluctuations.

### How the Grace Period Works

1. Your spending dips below $10k in a 30-day period
2. Counter increments (1st low-spend period)
3. If spending remains below $10k, counter continues (2nd period)
4. After **3 consecutive periods** below threshold -> Downgrade to Basic
5. If spending goes back above $10k at any point -> Counter resets to 0

<Info>
  **Active teams**: Tier checked before each request

  **Dormant teams**: Tier checked monthly on the 1st (prevents indefinite Enterprise status)
</Info>

## Savings Calculator

Enterprise tier saves you **2% on every request** compared to Basic:

| Monthly Spend | Basic Fee (7%) | Enterprise Fee (5%) | Monthly Savings |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| $10,000       | $700           | $500                | **$200** |
| $25,000       | $1,750         | $1,250              | **$500** |
| $50,000       | $3,500         | $2,500              | **$1,000** |
| $100,000      | $7,000         | $5,000              | **$2,000** |

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When does my tier update?">
    Your tier is calculated in real-time before each request based on your rolling 30-day spend. There's no waiting period--as soon as you cross $10k, your next request uses Enterprise pricing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I stop using the gateway for a few months?">
    Dormant Enterprise teams are checked monthly. If your 30-day spend stays below $10k for 3 consecutive months, you'll be downgraded to Basic tier.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I request a custom tier or discount?">
    Yes! For custom pricing, volume commitments, or enterprise agreements, contact our sales team at sales@example.com.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any minimum commitments?">
    No. You can use the Basic tier with no minimums, and you'll automatically upgrade to Enterprise when you reach the threshold.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do promotional codes work?">
    Promotional codes are applied during the Stripe checkout process when adding credits to your account. Stripe coupon codes provide percentage or fixed-amount discounts on your credit purchases.
