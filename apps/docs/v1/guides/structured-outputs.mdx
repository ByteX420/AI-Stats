title: "Structured Outputs"
description: "Produce JSON or schema-validated responses from models."
---

Structured outputs help you get predictable JSON from models. The Gateway passes structured-output settings through to providers that support them.

## Where to use it

Structured outputs are commonly used with `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions`. Some providers also expose schema enforcement on `/v1/messages`.

Check the [API Reference](../api-reference/introduction.mdx) for the supported request fields and response formats.

## Best practices

- Keep schemas small and explicit.
- Validate responses on the server before trusting them.
- Combine structured outputs with tool calling for reliable workflows.
