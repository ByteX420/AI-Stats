Most tools can connect to the Gateway by pointing their base URL to the AI Stats API and using an AI Stats API key. The guides below cover common integration patterns and caveats.

## General setup checklist

- Use your AI Stats API key as a Bearer token.
- Set the base URL to `https://api.phaseo.app/v1`.
- Pass model ids exactly as listed in the [Models endpoint](../../api-reference/endpoint/models.mdx).
- Use `/v1/messages` for Anthropic-compatible clients and `/v1/chat/completions` or `/v1/responses` for OpenAI-compatible clients.
