If your coding agent supports OpenAI-compatible configuration, you can route it through AI Stats.

## Recommended setup

- Base URL: `https://api.phaseo.app/v1`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <AI_STATS_API_KEY>`
- Endpoint: `/chat/completions` or `/responses`

## Tips

- Keep prompts and tool definitions consistent across environments.
- Use [Routing and fallbacks](../routing-and-fallbacks.mdx) guidance for production workloads.
