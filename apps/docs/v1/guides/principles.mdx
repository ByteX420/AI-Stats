AI Stats is built around a few simple principles that keep the platform reliable, open, and easy to use.

## Openness and transparency

- Keep the Gateway and data model auditable and easy to understand.
- Make pricing, routing, and performance visible wherever possible.

## One API for every model

- Provide a consistent surface that works across providers and modalities.
- Minimize provider-specific rewrites when models change.

## Portability and resilience

- Route requests to healthy providers and recover from upstream issues.
- Avoid lock-in by keeping the API compatible with major model ecosystems.

## Observability by default

- Capture usage, latency, and error signals so teams can operate safely.
- Expose diagnostics via the API and dashboard for production visibility.

## Respectful community

- Encourage constructive feedback and contributions from all users.
- Maintain clear contributor expectations and a shared code of conduct.

## Next steps

- Start with the [Quickstart](../quickstart.mdx).
- Learn [Routing and fallbacks](./routing-and-fallbacks.mdx).
- Dive into the [API Reference](../api-reference/introduction.mdx).
