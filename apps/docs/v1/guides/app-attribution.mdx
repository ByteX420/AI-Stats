title: "App Attribution"
description: "Attach app metadata to Gateway requests for analytics and auditing."
---

App attribution lets you tag requests with the app name and referer so usage appears correctly in analytics and audits.

## Supported headers

- `x-title`: Human-readable app name.
- `http-referer`: The URL that initiated the request.

## Example

```bash
curl https://api.phaseo.app/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_STATS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-title: Acme Support Bot" \
  -H "http-referer: https://acme.example/support" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize this ticket."}]
  }'
```

## Notes

- Keep titles consistent so dashboards group requests correctly.
- Referer values can be set by your infrastructure or reverse proxy if not provided by clients.
