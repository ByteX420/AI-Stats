Presets are reusable configurations that help teams standardize prompts, model preferences, and routing defaults. They are managed in the AI Stats dashboard and can be shared across a team.

## What a preset can include

- A system prompt to prepend to every request.
- Allowed models or model families.
- Provider allow/ignore lists for routing preferences.
- Default parameters (temperature, top_p, max_tokens, and similar settings).

Preset names are prefixed with `@` to keep them easy to recognize.

## Where to manage presets

Create and manage presets in **Dashboard -> Settings -> Presets**. Use them consistently across experiments and production workloads so the team is aligned on prompt and routing behavior.

## When to use presets

- Standardize system prompts across multiple services.
- Constrain routing to approved providers for compliance.
- Keep default parameters consistent across environments.
