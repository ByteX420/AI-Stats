description: "Use text, image, audio, video, and other modalities through the Gateway."

The Gateway exposes multiple modalities through a unified API surface. Each endpoint maps to a different capability, and model support varies by provider.

## Modalities and endpoints

| Modality | Primary endpoints | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | `/v1/responses`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages` | Structured and conversational outputs. |
| Images | `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/images/edits` | Text-to-image and image editing. |
| Audio | `/v1/audio/speech`, `/v1/audio/transcriptions`, `/v1/audio/translations` | Speech synthesis and speech-to-text. |
| Video | `/v1/videos`, `/v1/videos/{video_id}`, `/v1/videos/{video_id}/content`, `/v1/videos/{video_id}` (DELETE) | Create asynchronous video jobs, poll status, fetch content, and delete jobs. |
| Music | `/v1/music/generate` | Music generation via supported providers. |
| OCR | `/v1/ocr` | Extract text from images where supported. |

## Checking model support

Use the [Models endpoint](../api-reference/endpoint/models.mdx) to see which models are available and which endpoints they support. Provider coverage is available via the [Providers endpoint](../api-reference/endpoint/providers.mdx).

## Best practices

- Match the endpoint to the modality you need, even if the model name is shared across modalities.
- Validate payloads against the [API Reference](../api-reference/introduction.mdx) before shipping.
