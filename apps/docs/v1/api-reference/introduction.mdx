## Getting started

The full OpenAPI description that powers this reference lives alongside the docs. You
can import it into Postman, Hoppscotch, or your favourite SDK generator to bootstrap a
client automatically.

All production traffic should target **https://api.phaseo.app/v1**.
{/* A Cloudflare workers.dev preview is also available at **https://ai-stats-gateway.workers.dev** for testing. */}

All endpoint paths in this page are relative to that `/v1` base URL.

## Authentication

All endpoints require a gateway API key to help mitigate abuse. Supply it as
an `Authorization: Bearer` header. Keys have the form `aistats_v1_sk_` and
map back to the teams you manage inside the dashboard.

```http
Authorization: Bearer aistats_v1_sk_XXXX_example
```

If authentication fails you will receive a **401** error response.

## Endpoint overview

The table below outlines the main endpoints available in the AI Stats Gateway right now:

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /chat/completions`, `POST /responses`, `POST /messages` | Text generation across OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible surfaces. |
| `POST /embeddings`, `POST /moderations` | Embeddings and moderation checks. |
| `POST /audio/speech`, `POST /audio/transcriptions`, `POST /audio/translations` | Audio generation and speech-to-text. |
| `POST /images/generations`, `POST /images/edits` | Image generation and editing. |
| `POST /videos` | Create a video generation job (asynchronous). |
| `GET /videos/{video_id}` | Poll the video job status until complete. |
| `GET /videos/{video_id}/content`, `DELETE /videos/{video_id}` | Fetch completed video bytes or delete a job. |
| `POST /music/generate`, `GET /music/generate/{music_id}` | Create and poll music generation jobs. |
| `POST /ocr`, `POST /batches`, `GET /batches/{batch_id}`, `POST /files`, `GET /files`, `GET /files/{file_id}` | OCR, batch, and file operations. |
| `GET /models`, `GET /providers`, `GET /health`, `GET /generations?id=...` | Control-plane discovery and audit lookup endpoints. |

Use the `endpoints` query parameter on `GET /models` to reproduce the per-surface catalogues (chat, moderations, embeddings, images, video, or audio) without bouncing between separate endpoints.

The following endpoints are documented, but still under active work:

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /management/keys` | Coming Soon. |
| `GET /endpoints`, `GET /keys`, `POST /keys`, `GET /key` | Coming Soon placeholder endpoints. |

Responses include an optional `usage` and `meta` object with your usage, in both tokens and pricing, broken down into clear lines to
see what costs what, as well as detailed timing and performance metadata, such as throughput, latency, and generation time,
to support auditing and debugging.

## Rate limits & billing

We apply apply no rate limits directly on our platform, any rate limits are upstream, applied by the providers themselves,
we are working to get higher rate limits from the upstream providers to ensure that our users have a smooth experience.

We apply credit checks prior to all requests made, ensuring that you have a minimum of $1.00 of credit in the team wallet.
We do this to ensure that users do not accidentally rack up large bills on their accounts. You can top up your team wallet
via the dashboard at any time, with payments typically going through within a few minutes.
