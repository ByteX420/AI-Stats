---

Use `/v1/messages` to send Anthropic Messages API payloads through the gateway. The gateway normalizes your request into its internal IR, routes it to a compatible provider surface, and emits Anthropic-formatted responses.

## Endpoint

```http
POST /v1/messages
```

## Streaming

Set `stream: true` to receive server-sent events in Anthropic format (`message_start`, `content_block_*`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`).

## Notes

- The gateway honors the Anthropic request shape and supports tool use fields.
- The `X-AIStats-Strictness` header controls how unsupported parameters are handled.
