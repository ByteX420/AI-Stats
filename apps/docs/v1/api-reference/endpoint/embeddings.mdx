description: "How to reason about embedding models and how the Gateway surfaces them."

Embeddings are generated by routing text requests to the provider that currently offers the most accurate semantic vectors for your selected model. The Gateway exposes a single OpenAI-compatible `POST /embeddings` surface while adapting provider-specific knobs for Google Gemini and Mistral when they are supplied.

Key request fields:
- `input` (required): A string or array of strings to embed.
- `inputs` (alias): Optional alias for `input` if you prefer that shape.
- `dimensions`: Standard OpenAI output size hint.
- `embedding_options`: Provider-specific tuning knobs.
  - `embedding_options.google.output_dimensionality`, `embedding_options.google.task_type`, `embedding_options.google.title`
  - `embedding_options.mistral.output_dimension`, `embedding_options.mistral.output_dtype`

Use the [Models catalogue](./models.mdx) to see which providers list `embeddings` under their supported `endpoints` array. The same authentication headers you use elsewhere apply here as well.
