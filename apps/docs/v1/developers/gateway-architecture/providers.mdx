description: "How provider adapters are structured and where to add new ones."
---

Provider adapters live under `apps/api/src/providers`. Each adapter maps gateway-normalized payloads to provider-native requests and normalizes provider responses back to gateway shape.

## Folder layout

| Folder | Purpose | Key files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `providers/openai` | Native OpenAI endpoint mappings. | `index.ts`, `endpoints/*.ts` |
| `providers/openai-compatible` | Shared compatibility transport for OpenAI-like providers. | `config.ts`, `index.ts` |
| `providers/anthropic` | Anthropic provider mappings. | `index.ts`, `endpoints/*.ts` |
| `providers/google-ai-studio` | Google AI Studio provider mappings. | `index.ts`, `endpoints/*.ts` |
| `providers/x-ai` | xAI provider mappings. | `index.ts`, `endpoints/*.ts` |

## Key shared files

- `providers/index.ts` resolves adapters by provider id.
- `providers/types.ts` defines adapter contracts and return types.
- `providers/keys.ts` resolves BYOK and managed-key behavior.

## Adding a provider

1. Add a new folder under `apps/api/src/providers`.
2. Implement an adapter in `index.ts` for supported endpoints.
3. Register the adapter in `providers/index.ts`.
4. Add provider metadata/capabilities so routing can target it.
