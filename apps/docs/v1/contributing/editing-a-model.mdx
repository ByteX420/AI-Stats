Model data lives in JSON files under `apps/web/src/data/models`. Each model has its own folder and a `model.json` file.

## 1. Find the model

Locate the model directory by provider and model name, for example:

`apps/web/src/data/models/openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07/model.json`

## 2. Make your edits

Common updates include:

- Descriptions and links
- Capabilities and supported endpoints
- Pricing or availability notes
- Benchmark references

Keep values consistent with the existing schema in nearby files.

## 3. Validate data

Run the data validation script before opening a PR:

```bash
pnpm validate:data
```

## 4. Open a PR

Include a short summary of what changed and any sources used for the update.
