Before contributing to AI Stats, it's important to understand the **layout of the repository**.  
The project is designed for clarity and scalability - separating data, documentation, and app logic so you can easily find what you need.

---

## Overview

Here's what the root directory of the repository looks like:

```bash
AI-Stats/
+-- apps/
¦   +-- web/ # The main AI Stats Next.js website (contains data)
¦   +-- api/ # The AI Stats Gateway API (Hono/Cloudflare Workers)
¦   +-- docs/ # The Mintlify-powered documentation site
¦
+-- packages/ # SDKs and shared tooling
¦   +-- sdk-ts/
¦   +-- sdk-py/
¦   +-- sdk-go/
¦   +-- sdk-csharp/
¦   +-- sdk-php/
¦   +-- sdk-ruby/
¦   +-- sdk-java/
¦   +-- sdk-rust/
¦   +-- sdk-cpp/
¦   +-- ai-sdk-ai-stats/
¦
+-- scripts/ # Automation scripts and utilities
+-- .changeset/ # Release metadata

## Data folders

AI Stats stores its structured data in **JSON files** under the `/apps/web/src/data` directory.  
These files act as the source of truth for models, benchmarks, and pricing.

### `/apps/web/src/data/models`

Contains one JSON file per model.  
Each file describes the model's metadata, pricing, benchmarks, and capabilities.

Example:  
`/apps/web/src/data/models/openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07/model.json`

---

### `/apps/web/src/data/organisations`

Describes companies or research groups behind models.  
Each JSON file includes name, description, founding date, website, and country.

Example:  
`/apps/web/src/data/organisations/openai.json`

---

### `/apps/web/src/data/benchmarks`

Contains benchmark metadata and aggregated results across models.  
Each benchmark has an ID, name, description, category, and metrics.

Example:  
`/apps/web/src/data/benchmarks/mmlu.json`

---

### `/apps/web/src/data/api_providers`

Lists all supported API providers with their supported models.  
This links to both models and organisations.

Example:  
`/apps/web/src/data/api_providers/openai.json`

---

### `/apps/web/src/data/pricing`

Tracks historical pricing data over time for trend analysis.  
Files are timestamped and often aggregated by provider.

---

## Documentation folders

Documentation is written in **MDX** and lives in `/apps/docs/v1/`.  
Each folder maps directly to a group in the Mintlify configuration.

| Folder                        | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/apps/docs/v1/exploring`     | Explains data concepts (models, benchmarks, providers). |
| `/apps/docs/v1/contributing`  | Step-by-step guides for contributors.                   |
| `/apps/docs/v1/developers`    | Integration and API usage guides.                       |
| `/apps/docs/v1/api-reference` | Detailed reference for every endpoint.                  |
| `/apps/docs/v1/community`     | Support, FAQ, and community pages.                      |

## Application folders

| Path         | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/apps/web`  | Main AI Stats website, built with Next.js 15 and TailwindCSS. Contains the data under `src/data`. |
| `/apps/api`  | The API Gateway - routes, caching, and model proxy logic.                                         |
| `/apps/docs` | The Mintlify documentation project you're reading now.                                           |

Each app runs independently but shares types and configuration through `/packages`.

## Automation and scripts

AI Stats uses automation to keep data up to date:

-   **Importers** - pull new data from sources like Hugging Face or provider APIs.
-   **Watchers** - run on a schedule (via GitHub Actions) to detect and commit updates.
-   **Utilities** - handle validation, schema checking, and JSON formatting.

You can explore these under `/scripts/`.

---

## Where to start

If you're contributing:

-   **Data:** Look in `/apps/web/src/data/` for JSON files.
-   **Documentation:** Look in `/apps/docs/v1/` for MDX files.
-   **Code:** Explore `/apps/web` or `/apps/api`.
-   **Automation:** Modify or inspect `/scripts/`.
-   **SDKs:** Check `/packages/` for language-specific SDKs.
