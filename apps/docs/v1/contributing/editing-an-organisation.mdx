Organisation data lives in JSON files under `apps/web/src/data/organisations`.

## 1. Find the organisation

Each organisation is a single JSON file, for example:

`apps/web/src/data/organisations/openai.json`

## 2. Make your edits

Typical updates include:

- Name, description, and website
- Country code or metadata fields
- Relationship links to models or providers

Keep formatting and field order consistent with nearby files.

## 3. Validate data

Run the data validation script before opening a PR:

```bash
pnpm validate:data
```

## 4. Open a PR

Include sources or references for any factual changes.
